# DoReI (Android App) - doNate&Quest
## Bridge the gap to help the needy
DoReI is an Application through which people can donate and request for books and various stationery items (such as pens, pencils, bags etc) to
or from the organisation. It allows keeping records of all the donations, transactions and items donated or requested by users. It maintains these transactions at the software level while the physical transaction of collecting the books from donors and delivering them is verified by the managers of the application. Two seperate portals and interfaces for the user and manager helps in accomplishing this aim.
